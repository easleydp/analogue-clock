# Analogue Clock with Realistic Second Hand Physics - Technical Specification

This document is the technical specification for a reusable JavaScript library that renders an analogue clock on an HTML canvas. The primary feature is a sophisticated second hand that appears (to a casual observer) to exhibit realistic physical behaviors: an incremental once-per-second movement, overshooting its target due to momentum, recoiling, and a "priming" creep just before each tick. The hour and minute hands will move smoothly and continuously.

The library aims for a highly polished, realistic visual appearance and performant animation using `window.requestAnimationFrame()` and the HTML Canvas API.

## Project Summary

Develop a JavaScript-based analogue clock component for embedding in web pages. The clock should visually resemble a traditional wall clock, with an hour hand, minute hand, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîa second hand that moves in a realistic, physics-inspired fashion.

Rather than a smooth sweep (as seen in some quartz or digital clocks), the second hand should "tick" once per second, but with the addition of realistic motion effects:

1. Overshoot Behavior ‚Äî When the second hand "ticks" forward, it overshoots its target slightly due to simulated momentum, then quickly recoils back (undershooting slightly) before settling into the correct position.
2. Anticipatory Priming ‚Äî Roughly 150ms before a tick, the hand begins to subtly creep forward, simulating the mechanical torque build-up in physical clocks.

The component must use window.requestAnimationFrame() to animate the second hand in a performant and visually smooth way. The rendering should occur via the Canvas API and yield a polished and realistic visual appearance.

## Key Features

1. **Realistic Second Hand Movement**:

   - Incremental movement (once per second, not continuous sweep)
   - Mechanical physics simulation including:
     - Pre-tick tension/anticipation movement
     - Momentum-based overshoot, recoil and settle after each tick

2. **Complete Clock Face**:

   - Hour, minute, and second hands
   - Optional tick marks and numerals
   - Customizable appearance

3. **Lightweight and Performant**:
   - Optimized rendering using requestAnimationFrame
   - Minimal CPU usage when static

## 2. Core Functionality ‚öôÔ∏è

### 2.1. Clock Timekeeping

The clock will derive its time from the client's system clock (`new Date()`). It will update continuously to reflect the current hours, minutes, and seconds.

### 2.2. Hand Movements

#### 2.2.1. Hour Hand

- **Movement**: Smooth, continuous sweep.
- **Calculation**: The angle of the hour hand will be calculated based on the current hour (0-23) and the current minute, allowing for fractional positioning between hour marks.
  - Angle in degrees = `( (hours % 12) + minutes / 60 ) * 30` (where 0 degrees is 12 o'clock, positive is clockwise).

#### 2.2.2. Minute Hand

- **Movement**: Smooth, continuous sweep.
- **Calculation**: The angle of the minute hand will be calculated based on the current minute and the current second, allowing for fractional positioning between minute marks.
  - Angle in degrees = `( minutes + seconds / 60 ) * 6` (where 0 degrees is 12 o'clock, positive is clockwise).

#### 2.2.3. Second Hand (Base Behavior)

- **Movement**: Incremental, once per second, with added physics effects (see Section 3).
- **Normal Position**: The 'normal position' refers to the exact angular position corresponding to the current whole second (e.g., at 15 seconds, the hand points directly at the 3 o'clock position on the dial).
  - Normal Angle in degrees = `seconds * 6` (where 0 degrees is 12 o'clock, positive is clockwise).

## 3. Second Hand Realistic Physics ü§∏

The second hand's movement is characterized by a cycle of creep, tick with overshoot, recoil, and settling. A 'tick event' is defined as the moment the system clock transitions from one second to the next.

### 3.1. Animation Cycle States and Parameters

The second hand's animation proceeds through the following states within each second, driven by the `requestAnimationFrame` callback:

- **CREEPING**:
  - **Trigger**: Begins `CREEP_DURATION_MS` (default: 150ms) before the next tick event.
  - **Behavior**: The second hand smoothly advances from its current second's normal position by up to `CREEP_ANGLE_DEGREES` (default: 2 degrees, equivalent to 1/3 of a second of arc) over the `CREEP_DURATION_MS`. This movement is in addition to the normal position of the current second.
- **OVERSHOOT (Tick & Jump 1)**:
  - **Trigger**: Immediately upon the tick event (i.e., when `new Date().getSeconds()` changes).
  - **Behavior**: The second hand instantly jumps from its crept position to the **normal position of the new second** plus `OVERSHOOT_DEGREES` (default: 2 degrees).
  - **Visual**: This jump is rendered with a blur effect.
- **RECOIL (Jump 2)**:
  - **Trigger**: On the next `requestAnimationFrame` call after the OVERSHOOT phase.
  - **Behavior**: The second hand instantly jumps from its overshot position to the **normal position of the current second** plus `RECOIL_DEGREES` (default: -1.5 degrees, meaning it recoils behind the normal position).
  - **Visual**: This jump is rendered with a blur effect.
- **SETTLED (Jump 3)**:
  - **Trigger**: On the next `requestAnimationFrame` call after the RECOIL phase.
  - **Behavior**: The second hand instantly jumps from its recoiled position to the **normal position of the current second**.
  - **Visual**: This jump is rendered with a blur effect.
  - **Post-settle**: The hand remains in this normal position until the next CREEPING phase begins for the subsequent second.

### 3.2. Physics Animation Parameters (Defaults)

- `CREEP_DURATION_MS`: 150 ms
- `CREEP_ANGLE_DEGREES`: 2 degrees
- `OVERSHOOT_DEGREES`: 2 degrees (positive, beyond target)
- `RECOIL_DEGREES`: -1.5 degrees (negative, behind target)

### 3.3. Blur Effect for Second Hand

- **Application**: The blur effect is applied to the second hand during rendering immediately after the three sudden jumps (OVERSHOOT, RECOIL, SETTLED transitions).
- **Implementation**: The blur effect should suggest rapid motion. This can be achieved using the canvas context's `shadowBlur` and `shadowColor` properties temporarily set to create a directional blur. The intensity and direction should enhance the perception of quick movement. The blur should be removed in subsequent frames where the hand is static or creeping.

## 4. Rendering Details üé®

### 4.1. Canvas Setup

- The library will require an HTML `<canvas>` element ID to render into.
- The canvas will be cleared entirely on each frame before redrawing.
- The clock will be centered within the canvas. The size of the clock will be determined by the smaller of the canvas width or height.

### 4.2. Clock Face Appearance

- **Dial**: A circular dial. Color customizable.
- **Numerals**: Standard 1-12 Arabic numerals. Font, size, and color customizable. Option to disable.
- **Tick Marks**:
  - Major tick marks at each hour. Style (length, thickness, color) customizable.
  - Minor tick marks at each minute. Style (length, thickness, color) customizable. Option to disable.
- **Center Pin/Pivot**: A small circle at the center where hands are mounted. Style customizable.

### 4.3. Hand Appearance

- **General**: All three hands (hour, minute, second) should originate from the center of the clock.
- **Style**: Customizable properties for each hand type:
  - Length (as a percentage of clock radius)
  - Width/Thickness
  - Color
  - Shape (e.g., simple rectangle, tapered, with a counterweight for the second hand).
- **Shadow Effect**: All three hands must be rendered with a shadow to suggest a 3D appearance.
  - Shadow properties (offset X, offset Y, blur radius, color) should be configurable. Example defaults: `shadowOffsetX = 2`, `shadowOffsetY = 2`, `shadowBlur = 3`, `shadowColor = 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)'`.

## 5. Library API and Configuration üß©

## 7. Assumptions and Constraints üìã

- **Browser Environment**: The library is intended for modern web browsers that support HTML Canvas API and `window.requestAnimationFrame()`.
- **Performance**: It is assumed that the client's system has sufficient processing power and a monitor refresh rate of at least 60Hz for smooth animation. `requestAnimationFrame` will be used to optimize rendering timing.
- **System Clock Accuracy**: The clock's accuracy is dependent on the accuracy of the client's system clock. The specification does not require handling of manual system clock changes by the user while the clock is running, though the logic should be robust to minor variations.
- **Single Instance**: The pseudocode and state management assume a single clock instance or properly encapsulated instances if multiple clocks are used on one page. Each instance would have its own state.
